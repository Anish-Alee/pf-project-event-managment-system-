Introduction
The Event Management System is a beginner-level project developed in C language, designed for students learning programming fundamentals. It helps manage small events by storing and displaying information like event name, date, location, and participants. This project allows students to apply basic concepts such as structures, arrays, functions, and file handling.
Problem Statements
- Manual event tracking is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Lack of a simple tool for beginners to manage event data.
- Students need practical examples to apply C programming concepts.

Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Display menu (Add event, View events, Search event, Exit)
3. If 'Add event' selected, take input and store in file/array
4. If 'View events' selected, display all stored events
5. If 'Search event' selected, take input and search by name/date
6. If 'Exit', end program
7. Repeat from step 2
Note: A simple flowchart can show user interaction with options and data handling steps.
Features
- Add new event details
- View all saved events
- Search for events by name or date- Simple and menu-driven interface- File storage (optional for saving data)
Objectives
- To introduce students to real-life applications of C programming- To improve understanding of data handling and user interaction
